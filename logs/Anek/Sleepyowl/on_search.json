Though surprisingly high in fat for a bean, it’s mostly the healthy unsaturated kind. A significant number of research studies support claims that soy protein can help you lose weight.

Because when hair is sleek and conditioned, it reflects more light, giving that beautiful shiny finish. Protect the health and shine of your hair with the Daily Shine Conditioner from Dove. Enriched with our Nutritive Serum, Dove Daily Shine Conditioner smooths over the strands' cuticles, leaving soft, silky hair with added strength and shine from the very first wash. All you need to do is, apply a small amount of conditioner to your hair from mid lengths to tips and rinse it off after a minute to get shiny and manageable hair, every day. And because we don't want daily wear and tear to get in the way of our shine, it protects hair from future damage, even from your brush. Not only does the formula give visible results after the first use, but it makes hair better*, making it look healthy. For hair that's soft, smooth and beautiful with every wash, Dove Daily Shine Conditioner is an ideal addition to your hair care routine. *Based on lab test with Dove Daily Shine System vs non-conditioning shampoo.",

With a pH of 3.5, V Wash restores pH in the intimate area and helps to prevent irritation, itching and dryness in the intimate area.\nThe vagina has a natural protective layer which is acidic in nature, to help prevent infection. This layer is maintained when good bacteria called lactobacilli produce Lactic acid , which maintains the acidic environment at a pH value of 3.5 to 4.5. This promotes the growth of lactobacilli, inhibiting the presence of harmful bacteria and preventing infection. A healthy vaginal flora requires a pH of 3.5 - 4.5. Most soaps are alkaline in nature which have a pH value of 8 & above. The daily use of soap to cleanse the vaginal area may upsets ideal pH balance of the vagina. This may leads to vaginal discomforts like dryness, irritation & itching and could eventually lead to vaginal infections.\nVWash PLUS has lactic acid which restores vaginal pH balance and is enriched with sea buckthorn oil which contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants & amino acids. Daily washing with VWash PLUS leaves a fresh sensation & maintains healthy vaginal flora. It also helps prevent unpleasant odour & irritation in the intimate area.It is safe for daily use. It is Paraben & SLS/SLES free. VWash Plus is usable during periods as well.\nNow don’t just wash, VWash PLUS.\"",

Everyday damage can stress strands, leaving them prone to breakage and hair fall. Presenting New Dove Healthy Ritual for Growing Hair Conditioner is inspired by the rituals of North American women. The ritual uses natural ingredients like cone flower, oil and white tea which are known de-stressors, to nourish hair and help it reach its natural growth potential by keeping it healthy and long. Dove borrowed this healthy ritual and created the new Healthy Ritual for Growing Hair. Combined with the superior care of Dove, the formula instantly smoothens out the hair surface, preventing frizz and keeps hair looking smooth and shiny. It works to reduce frizz, making hair appear smooth and controls fly away hair. Due to strands being smooth, they detangle easily, minimising breakage and letting your hair look long and smooth. Dove believes hair can look good at any length, as long as it is properly cared for. So give your hair the love it deserves.

										"long_desc": "\"Silk is a natural microfiber, enveloped in the warmth of cocoon during its nascent stage. Its amino acid composition is close to that of human skin and when the silk fiber comes in contact with water, it becomes ultra-sensitive to abrasion. Just like how chemicals can react on our skin and prove to be harmful, similarly, regular detergents can make these silk fabrics look chaffed, brittle and as if covered with white residue. Love & Care is an expert range of fabric wash designed to take care of your special clothes, it is a pH balanced formula which is designed to be gentle on silk and retains shine unlike regular detergents. The expert care liquid detergent is crafted with No Enzymes and No Bleach which maintains the strength and colour of the fabric. The next time you flaunt your chanderi silk kurta, mysore silk sari or banarasi dupatta with zari work remember to care for it as well with a gentle hand wash of Love & Care. It maintains the flowiness of Chiffons, cares for the drapes on Crepe and gives an overall bouncy look to Georgettes. The Love & Care range is recommended by India’s leading fashion designer Manish Malhotra who is an expert in fabrics and fashion. Love & Care is a brand of Hindustan Unilever Limited.\"\nAuthentic wool is made of a protein called keratin which is also responsible for keeping our hair follicles healthy and nourished. Most detergents contain chemicals like enzymes which are extremely harsh on delicate woollen wear, making them weakened, mis-shaped, cause holes in them and also takes away their natural softness. Love & Care is carefully designed with pH neutral formula – thereby maintaining its softness and lustre. It keeps your precious woollens looking newer for much longer. The Soft Woollens variant is specially designed to be extremely mild on your soft woollen clothes. The liquid detergent is designed to be pH neutral that keep the strength of the wool intact. The No Enzymes and No Bleach formula cares for delicate fibres, prevents shrinkage of your woollens and retains new like shine. The low foaming formula also avoids over rinsing and prevents shrinkage of your woollen wear, keeps it looking new. The next time you flaunt your beautiful woollen sweater remember to care for it as well with a gentle hand wash of Love & Care.

										"long_desc": "\"The best defence against any vaginal discomfort is prevention. Protect your most delicate area with daily use of a special product – VWash PLUS. With a pH of 3.5, V Wash restores pH in the intimate area and helps to prevent irritation, itching and dryness in the intimate area.\nThe vagina has a natural protective layer which is acidic in nature, to help prevent infection. This layer is maintained when good bacteria called lactobacilli produce Lactic acid , which maintains the acidic environment at a pH value of 3.5 to 4.5. This promotes the growth of lactobacilli, inhibiting the presence of harmful bacteria and preventing infection. A healthy vaginal flora requires a pH of 3.5 - 4.5. Most soaps are alkaline in nature which have a pH value of 8 & above. The daily use of soap to cleanse the vaginal area may upsets ideal pH balance of the vagina. This may leads to vaginal discomforts like dryness, irritation & itching and could eventually lead to vaginal infections.\nVWash PLUS has lactic acid which restores vaginal pH balance and is enriched with sea buckthorn oil which contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants & amino acids. Daily washing with VWash PLUS leaves a fresh sensation & maintains healthy vaginal flora. It also helps prevent unpleasant odour & irritation in the intimate area.It is safe for daily use. It is Paraben & SLS/SLES free. VWash Plus is usable during periods as well.\nNow don’t just wash, VWash PLUS.\"",

With a pH of 3.5, V Wash restores pH in the intimate area and helps to prevent irritation, itching and dryness in the intimate area.\nThe vagina has a natural protective layer which is acidic in nature, to help prevent infection. This layer is maintained when good bacteria called lactobacilli produce Lactic acid , which maintains the acidic environment at a pH value of 3.5 to 4.5. This promotes the growth of lactobacilli, inhibiting the presence of harmful bacteria and preventing infection. A healthy vaginal flora requires a pH of 3.5 - 4.5. Most soaps are alkaline in nature which have a pH value of 8 & above. The daily use of soap to cleanse the vaginal area may upsets ideal pH balance of the vagina. This may leads to vaginal discomforts like dryness, irritation & itching and could eventually lead to vaginal infections.\nVWash PLUS has lactic acid which restores vaginal pH balance and is enriched with sea buckthorn oil which contains an abundance of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants & amino acids. Daily washing with VWash PLUS leaves a fresh sensation & maintains healthy vaginal flora. It also helps prevent unpleasant odour & irritation in the intimate area.It is safe for daily use. It is Paraben & SLS/SLES free. VWash Plus is usable during periods as well.\nNow don’t just wash, VWash PLUS.\"",
